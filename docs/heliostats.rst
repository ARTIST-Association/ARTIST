Understanding Heliostats
========================

``ARTIST`` is a digital twin for concentrating solar tower power plants. One of the most important aspects of these plants
are the **heliostats** - the mirrors that reflect light onto the receiver. Heliostats aren't just perfect flat mirrors; they are
complex structures that must be accurately modeled. In ``ARTIST``, we model heliostats using three key components: a
**surface**, a **kinematic model**, and **actuators**. This page provides a brief overview of how we include heliostats
in ``ARTIST`` and details the specific models we support.

Surfaces
^^^^^^^^
The surface is a crucial element of a heliostat, as it's responsible for reflecting light onto the receiver. Accurately
modeling the surface is of utmost importance. In ``ARTIST``, a surface consists of multiple facets, which can be canted
at an angle to improve sunlight concentration.

Most commonly, heliostats in ``ARTIST`` consist of four facets, as shown in the image below.

As you can see, each facet has a ``position`` relative to the heliostat's center and canting direction vectors
(``canting_e``, ``canting_n``) that define its orientation.

Kinematic
^^^^^^^^^
The heliostat's kinematic model describes the motion of its mechanical system. It's used to predict the final orientation
of the heliostat surface based on variable inputs. The kinematic model is also used to calculate the aligned surface points
and normals for a predicted orientation. The choice of kinematic type can depend on the type and number of actuators or
the availability of a dataset on the positions, orientations, and movements of the heliostat's mechanical system.

The abstract class ``Kinematic`` contains a method to align the heliostat surface, which internally first computes the
desired orientation for a given input. All derived kinematic types override this method.

``ARTIST`` currently supports the following kinematic type:

- ``RigidBody``

This rigid body kinematic model uses a two-actuator structure, allowing movement in two directions. These actuators
introduce mechanical offsets, described by translation vectors for three components: joint one, joint two, and the concentrator.
These vectors point in the east, north, and up directions, as shown in the image below.

Actuators
^^^^^^^^^
Heliostat actuators are the motors responsible for adjusting the heliostat's surface orientation to direct sunlight onto
a defined aim point. The actuators are described by ``actuator_parameters``, which may contain information on motor
turning direction, step size, or offsets. These parameters are essential for initialization.

The abstract class ``Actuators`` contains one method to map motor steps to angles and another to map angles to motor steps.
All derived actuator types override these methods.

``ARTIST`` currently supports the following actuator types:

- ``LinearActuators``
- ``IdealActuators``

The ``LinearActuator`` is modeled on the actuator used in the JÃ¼lich power plant and includes the following parameters:
