Welcome to ``ARTIST``
=====================
``ARTIST`` stands for **AI-enhanced differentiable Ray Tracer for Irradiation Prediction in Solar
Tower Digital Twins**.
The ``ARTIST`` package provides an implementation of a fully differentiable ray tracer using the `PyTorch`_
machine-learning framework in ``Python``. Leveraging automatic differentiation and GPU computation, it facilitates the
optimization of heliostats, towers, and camera parameters within a solar field by combining gradient-based optimization
methods with smooth parametric descriptions of heliostats.

|:sunny:| Our key contributions include:

* **Immediate deployment:** ``ARTIST`` enables deployment at the beginning of a solar thermal plant's operation,
  allowing for in-situ calibration and subsequent improvements in energy efficiencies and cost reductions.

* **Neural-network driven heliostat calibration:** A two-layer hybrid model for most efficient heliostat calibration.
  It comprises a robust geometric model for pre-alignment and a neural network disturbance model, which gradually adapts
  its impact via regularization sweeps. In this way, high data requirements of data-centric methods are overcome while
  maintaining flexibility for modeling complex real-world systems. Check out this paper for more details |:point_down:|:

* **Surface reconstruction and flux density prediction:** Leveraging learning Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS),
  ``ARTIST`` reconstructs heliostat surfaces accurately using calibration images commonly available in solar thermal
  power plants. Thus, we can achieve sub-millimeter accuracy in mirror reconstruction from focal spot images,
  contributing to improved operational safety and efficiency. The reconstructed surfaces can be used for predicting
  unique heliostat flux densities with state-of-the-art accuracy. Check out this paper for more details |:point_down:|:
