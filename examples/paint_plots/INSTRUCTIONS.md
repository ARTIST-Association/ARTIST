# Example Code for ``PAINT`` Plots

This examples folder contains code to replicate the plots presented in our paper "PAINT: The First FAIR Database for
Concentrating Solar Power Plants".

## How to Use:

There are two plots present in our paper that are generated using ``ARTIST``. In order to replicate these plots it is important
to execute the code in the correct order.

### Run First

Regardless of which plot you wish to generate, you must first run the code to download the data, this consists of two scripts:

1. ``download_metadata.py``: This script will download all the metadata associated with the ``PAINT`` database. It will take a while to run.
2. ``download_data.py``: Based on the metadata, this script will now download all the required calibration, deflectometry, and tower data from the ``PAINT`` database required for the plots. It will also take a while to run.

### Calibration Plot

To replicate the calibration plots, please run the following scripts in the correct order:

1. TODO
2. TODO

### Flux Prediction Plot

To replicate the flux prediction plot, please run the following scripts in the correct order:

1. TODO
